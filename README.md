*Course Description*
Visualization, simulation, and modeling of soically-relevant data has become an increasingly prominent part of online discourse and public understanding of the world. In this course, we will explore the theory and practice of using interactive visualizations of many different sorts to increase understanding of complex, socially-relevant topics in science, technology, and society. This will involve exploring the ways in which several different moes of web-based tools enable different kind of communication possibilities relating to simulations, models, and data. Students will be exposed to many pre-existing forms of interactive communication, as well as scholarly analysis and frameworks for making critical sense of these attempts. Students will also be engaged in the active creation fo their own visualizations, culminating in an original contribution in the form of their final project. Though coding and graphic design are skills to be used and developed throughout this course, no preqrequisite experience is needed.
