## Course Description

Visualization, simulation, and modeling of soically-relevant data has become an increasingly prominent part of online discourse and public understanding of the world. In this course, we will explore the theory and practice of using interactive visualizations of many different sorts to increase understanding of complex, socially-relevant topics in science, technology, and society. This will involve exploring the ways in which several different moes of web-based tools enable different kind of communication possibilities relating to simulations, models, and data. Students will be exposed to many pre-existing forms of interactive communication, as well as scholarly analysis and frameworks for making critical sense of these attempts. Students will also be engaged in the active creation fo their own visualizations, culminating in an original contribution in the form of their final project. Though coding and graphic design are skills to be used and developed throughout this course, no preqrequisite experience is needed. </br>

### CAL Objectives

1. Students will demonstrate an awareness of ethical responsibility and the societal impact of their future profession.
2. Students will demonstrate a fuller understanding of the traditional humanities and social sciences through an understanding of their relation to the study of sciences and technology.
3. Students will demonstrate an awareness of cultures and societies other than their own.
4. Students will demonstrate writing and public speaking skills.
5. Students will demonstrate a love of learning in the liberal arts for its own sake.

## Required Books

None. All readings will be provided as PDFs or handouts. All software needed will be either free or provided under the "educational fair use" exception to copyright law to be used only for limited purposes of this course.

## Course Ethos

This is a course about jumping in and making things. But at the same time, it is also about thinking critically about what you are making. These are two sometimes contradictory approaches to the world - we want to be *makers* and *thinkers*. We do not want to make so much, and so slowly, that we do not make. </br>
</br>
In this course you will be asked to read, write, design, and even program. This is a lot to do at once. You can do it, even if you have never done some of these things before (I presume you have written and read, but designing and programming are potentially new skills). This course has no prerequisites. This is by design - this course is in part about the way in which the technical skills for doing interesting, interactive, web-based design have dropped dramatically over the past decade. You will be given templates, instructions, and hands-on assitance, but it is *imperative* that you embrace that idea that some of what you are being asked to do may be a little at the edge of your comfort zone, and it is your job to find a way to an answer. You will be teaching yourself at least as much as I will be teaching you, ideally. </br>
</br>
You are, of course, welcome and expected to ask for help. You will have access to "coding office hours" run by a fellow student, which is where you go if you need basic  help, or cannot figure out why your code doesn't work. If you have more conceptual issues, or issues that aren't solved by the coding office hours, then reach out to me. When formulating your requests for help, take the time to write out what you are trying to do, what you have tried, what doesn't seem to work. Often you will find that in trying to articulate what your problem is, the answer will become visible, but even if it does not, it will help others help you. </br>
</br>
You may collaborate with your colleagues, however all work you turn in must be ultimately the result of your own effort, except for the final group project, where your contribution will be part of a collective. Obviously the line her can be a blurry one, especially when we are talking about computer code. It is not OK to ask for help debugging code, or even help in structuring an algorithm. It is not OK to just have your CS major roommate write it all for you. Endeavor to be honest in your work and you will do fine. By "general coding solutions" I mean answers to very "solved" problems (like how to randomly assign dots within a circle, or  how to shuffle a deck of cards randomly) - you do not need to reinvent the wheel on these kind of things. </br>
</br>
Any data, code, or assistance you get from someone else should be explicitly acknowledged. This is a good way to avoid plagiarism. Treat any code you write the same way (ethically) you would treat a research paper - "cite your sources." A key part of this course is about "mashing up" different types of data and code - there is no shame in using someone else's data or model! But cite your sources! </br>
</br>
You will be encouraged to acquire your own data sources and develop your own models over the course of this class. You are given consierable leeway in doing this. Just don't do anything illegal or unethical. If you have any questions about the legality/ethical aspects, get in touch with me *before* getting or using the data. </br>
</br>
According to the current Stevens intellectual property policy, undergraduates "students shall retain ownership of invetnions conceived or first reduced to practice as part of class work." That should cover anything done in this course - you own it, make it worth your while!

## Office hours

I have employed a fellow student of yours who will be the "first point of contact" for help with your code - the aforementioned "coding office hours." This student has experience coding and has worked with me before. I will announce details in class. You should go to them if your problem is code-related. If they cannot answer your question, or your question is not inherently code-related (e.g.., if it is about the basic concepts), you should feel free to come to my regular office hours or set up an alternative appointment. (This is about keeping my office hours from just becoming debugging sessions, which becomes a huge drain on my time.) </br>
</br>
Debugging code is tough for *everyone*, even experienced programmers. It is especially toguh when you are starting out, because you have not really picked up a "feel" for common kinds of errors, or even developed the sense of how to quickly see when a comma was used rather than a semicolon. Don't get too frustrated, don't take it personally, don't feel embarrased if something you labored over for far too long turns out to be a painfully simple fix.

## OneDrive

All students enrolled in this course will have a OneDrive shared drive assigned to them. This is where you will put your coding projects when you are ready to submit them, and where you can keep active projects if you want me or the TA to be able to see them (e.g., if you need help with bugs). </br>
</br>
**Both I and the coding TA will be able to see and edit any files you put into this particular folder.** You should **not** expect any privacy over the files you put in this folder. Do not put anything inappropiate in this folder.

## Grading and Course Policies

Attendance is mandatory. We meet once a week, so missing a week is a lot of class. We will be doing hands-on activities in class that will be **very** hard to make up. Please try not to miss class. </br>
</br>
If you, however, feel ill - please feel free to miss class. I do not require a doctor's note; I will trust you. I would rather be taken advantage of in my leniency than have diseases spread to me or your fellow students. </br>
</br>
**Laptops will be used for in-class assignments and should be brought.** When we are doing in-class assignments on laptops, do not waste time by browsing e-mail, social media, websites, etc. - stay on task. </br>
</br>
Grades will be based on the following criteria:

* Class participation and attendance: 25%
* Homework and small assignments: 25%
* Midterm project: 20%
* Final project: 30%

Percentages are approximate. I will determine final weights at the end of the course. Note that this is one of the *rare* Stevens courses where you are graded largely on *effort*! Take risks! Try hard things! And most importantly: everyone will be coming to this class with a different level of experience and different skill sets. This is an opportunity to expand beyond what you've done before, to push into the unknwon. *Take advantaage of it!* Even if your final project isn't beautiful, or event totally functional, you can still get a great grade in the class if I think you've pushed yourself. Failure is often more instructional than success! </br>
</br>
Your final project grade will be based on your particular participation in the group as well as the overall group work. More details will be given. Don't be that student who makes group work hard for the others - I'll know, I wasn't born yesterday, it's awlays pretty obvious! </br>
</br>
Obviously do not try to get an AI to do your homework for you, as amusing as that might sound.

## Writing & Communications Center

The College of Arts & Letters maintains the [Writing & Communications Center at Stevens](https://www.stevens.edu/page-basic/stevens-writing-and-communications-center) in Morton 210. Their office hours are Monday-Friday, 11 am-5 pm. You can stop in or make an appointment to get help with your written papers, presentations, and all other work you do at Stevens. Writing and presenting are *skills* and like all skills they can *always* be *improved*.

## Honor Board Policies

You should by now be familiar with [The Honor System at the Stevens Institute of Technology](https://web.stevens.edu/honor/). It is your responsibility to uphold the ideals set forth in the Honor System Constitution. Specific student responsibilities include:

* Maintaining honesty and fair play in all aspects of academic life at Stevens;
* Writing and signing the pledge, in full, on all submitted academic work;
* Reporting any suspected violations to an Honor Board member or to the Dean of Student Development;
* Cooperating with the Honor Board during investigations and hearings

If you ever have questions about how to interpret the Honor System in relation to your work in this class, please get in touch with me. See "Course Ethos" above for the policy on collaboration/assistance.

## Students with Disabilities

If you require special accomodations due to a disability, or if you need individual arrangements should the building be evacuated, you must inform the [Office of Disability Services](https://www.stevens.edu/student-diversity-and-inclusion/disability-services) in Martha Bayard Stevens Hall, 3rd floor (201.216.3748), and complete the Faculty Contact Form. Once you have done so, you should ask to meet with me so that we can work out any special arrangements that may be necessary.

## Written Assignments

There will be several short written assignments required over this course. They will involve responding to specific questions and prompts, and will require no more than 2-3 pages of writing. You may have less than a week to complete them, but you will know about them in advance. There will also be regular "homework" - assignments to complete before the next class. </br>
</br>
All written assignments have the same formatting guidelines: Times New Roman, double-spaced, 12 pt font, 1-inch margins. Your name should be at the top of the first page; page numbers should be at the bottom. You need to cite any sources you use - please use some kind of inline or footnote style that indicates which page, etc., you are referencing from. You can use any legitimate citation style (I prefer Turabian); if you use an online citation software, please double-check the citations they create against a style-guide (because they are *often* completely incorrect).

## Projects

This course is built around several small projects (currently, a medium-sized midterm project,) and a final project). All but the final projects are individual projects for each student to do on their own. The final project will be a very open-ended collaborative project, working as a team to create some kind of interesting and novel piece of software on a topic of interest to you (within the very lenient bounds of the course: it must be socially-relevant) that builds upon the skills and methods explored in the course. </br>
</br>
You will get more information about the projects as they develop. They will start "easy," with very well-defined goals, and gradually become more open-ended. </br>
</br>
Ultimately your project grades will reflect three components:

1. Theory/analysis (can you explain why it works?)
2. Effort (how hard did you work at it?)
3. Execution (does it work, is it effective?)

Some of these aspects are obviously subjective, but it is your job in the theory/analysis component to explain what the effort was and why the execution is successful. I might not agree, but you are being given a chance to make your case! </br>
</br>
If you are entering this class with more advanced programming skills, I will be expecting you to flex them in your projects. Don't do the bare minimum - I am giving you an excuse to do some interesting stuff and get credit for it! If you are entering with more minimal programming abilities, just do your best - you'll learn something, even if it doesn't feel like it!

## Useful software

This is for links to software that you may find useful for this class.

### Code editors / IDEs

If you already use an editor or IDE you are comfortable with, just use that. If you don't know what an IDE even is, you probably want to dwonload one of the below. (IDE = Integrated Development Environment, a program thati s designed to help you write and manage coding.)

* [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Windows or Mac) - This is rapidly becoming the "standard" free IDE. THe main advantage to it over other text editors, to my mind, is that it is fairly "smart" when it comes to syntax highlighting and bug finding, and if you open a directory in it, it lets you easily access the files for standard projects. I find some of its default settings impossible to use - I disable "Auto closing quotes," "Auto closing brackets," "Auto closing tags" because otherwise it keeps trying to edit my code in ways I find irritating and not helpful. There are also very advanced freatures, like integrating it with GitHub, that I don't use, and sometimes take some effort to turn off notifications about. But overall a pretty useful way to organize your projects and code, and a pretty useful code editor.
* There are also several "advanced" text editors that are popular, if you for whatever reason find the idea or practice of an IDE difficult. If you are starting off, I would recommend trying VS Code first and seeing if you are used to it, as it *does* make certain things easier (like remembering functions and their variables, and finding mis-matched quotes and parentheses and so on) once you get the hang of its idiosyncrasies. The below are basically just beefed up versions of Notepad that are tailored to coding, and prety bare-bones by comparison, though there is something to be said for learning to code that way (that's how I did it).
  * [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows only) - extremely bare-bones text editor for Windows that is nonetheless more full-featured than your Normal Notepad
  * [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (Mac only) - sort of like Notepad++ for Macs. (Click "Free download," after 30 days reverts to "free mode" which is still totally fine because you won't likely be using the advanced features anyway)
  * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - sort of an intermediary between VS Code and the more bare-bones text editors; more features than Notepad++ or BBEdit, not as much "overhead" as VS Code. Free to "evaluate," which means it will nag you periodically to buy it, which you can ignore, but the nagging can get pretty irritating after a while.

### Node.js

You will eventually need to install Node.js when we get to the Phaser assignment. You can download and install it [here]([)](https://nodejs.org/en/). I will give you detailed instructions on how to use it for your projects for this class.

### Local web hosts

You will eventually need to install a local web host if you do not have one already, so that your computer can emulate being a web server (this is because modern browsers limit what scripts can do if they are not hosted, to limit the spraed of viruses and whatnot). </br>
</br>
I may have a very limited web host ready that we can use for this class that will be usable for the limited purposes we need it to be. </br>
</br>
If you want to install a fully-featured web host, the most common setup is called a WAMP or a MAMP. AMP stands for Apache + MySQL + PHP, three commonly bundled software packages (Apache is a web server, MySQL is a database server, PHP is server-side programming language). (W = Windows, M = Mac.) Apache is all we really care about, but installing Apache by itself is a pain in the neck. Installing a full WAMP or MAMP can be a lot of work and debugging, and if you don't set it up right, can open your computer up for security problems. But if you are interested in doing "full stack" web development in the future, you might want to do this, just to get a feel for it. </br>
</br>
The ones I have used myself and for teaching in the past are:

* [WAMPServer](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) (Windows) - a full-featured WAMP that is realtively easy to install and maintain for Windows. Runs in a tray icon. The server files by default are kept in the "www" directory of wherever you install it.
* [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp/mac/) (Mac and, apparently Windows) - I've only used this on a Mac. It has been a little less straightforward to set up than WAMPServer out of the box, but I've managed to get it working. It tries to get you to buy MAMP Pro, and I've just ignored that, and it has seemed to work fine no matter what.

Again, if you don't know what a WAMP/MAMP really is, and are not that interested in learning, wait until later in the semester and I may have a much simpler alternative available that will do what we need for the class and no more, because we will not be using MySQL or PHP and do not need a server with all of the complicated configuration options as Apache.

### Image editors

There will be some assignments where being able to manipulate bitmap graphics (e.g., PNGs and JPEGs) would be useful. If you don't already have a pirated copy of Photoshop, and aren't made of money, these are some OK alternatives:

* [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) (Windows) - a decent-enough bitmap editor, an upgrade from the default Paint program included in Windows. Nowhere as fully-featured as Photoshop, but lets you import and export pretty much any file format you would want to use, allows the use of layers and effects and tools.
* [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) (Windows or Mac) - an open-source bitmap editor that is in principle capable of doing a lot, but is really a pain to use in my experience, because it is built around a Linux-user's view of software, which as you will find is very different in many ways from a Windows or Mac user's idea of a godd time, or an intuitive interface. But it's free.

## Class-time Policies

This course mixes reading, writing, talking, and making. You will be expected to do all four simultaneously. You are capable of it. </br>
</br>
There will be in-class activities that will require laptops. Please bring one to class. If your laptop gets damaged or cannot otherwise be used, check one out from the library to use. </br>
</br>
Part of our job in class will be to critique one another's work. Treat your fellow students well. This does not mean you should "go easy" on them in critiquing their work - we all benefit from constructive, careful criticism. Similarly, it is OK to get annoyed at the criticism of another, and you are not required to do what they suggest or say (even if I am the one making the suggestion!).
