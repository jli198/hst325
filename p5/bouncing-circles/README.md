# bouncing-circles

For your programming homework this week, I want you to modify the sketch.js file in the sample-project we looked at in class (the p5.js demo code, which is [available here](../sample-project/) Download available here) so that, at a minimum, it does the following: </br>

* Instead of spawning one piece of text that bounces around the screen, change it so that it instead spawns a large number (you can pick the number, but it must be more than 10) circles that have different fills and different strokes (outlines). The circles should bounce off of the edges of the screen.
* You should use Arrays (collections of objects) and a for loop (a way to iterate over a collection of objects, or repeat something a given number of times) to spawn the circles. Do not just paste the spawning code 100 times or something.
* For drawing the circles, see the functions in the [Shape section the p5.js Reference manual.](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape)
* I will be posting my little "guide to Javascript" in a day or so but if you wanted to get started before that, [this page on Arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) is not terrible, and [this page on the for loop](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp) explains the basics of it and gives several examples of how to iterate over an array (which just means, "go through every element in an array, so you can do something to those elements).

If you are a hardcore programmer who thinks this is boring, I want you to make me something along the lines of this demo that makes my face to melt off. If my face ain't melting, I'm not impressed. </br>
</br>
When you are done with the project, make a folder in your OneDrive titled "p5-project" and put a copy of your p5 directory and the project directory (e.g. "sample-project") into that folder, so I can easily access it. </br>
</br>
For the "assignment" here on Canvas, just write up a) how you went about doing this assignment (briefly is fine), and b) any challenges you faced (or confusion, or whatever).
